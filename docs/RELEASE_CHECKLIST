1. Make sure tests are currently passing
2. If needed, update example.png, MAN.txt, and qr-backup.1.man, and USAGE.md
   a. ./qr-backup --generate-docs docs/example.txt [see: https://github.com/za3k/qr-backup/issues/65]
   b. USAGE.md needs updated manually
3. Update CHANGELOG and CONTRIBUTORS
4. Update the version number in the code and CHANGELOG.
5. Commit and tag the code.
6. Build the source packages (requires signing key)
    make all
7. Build the debian package (requires debuild -- tests currently fail on debian so no package ATM)
    make deb
8. In github, generate a release from the tag.
    a. Copy the release notes from CHANGELOG
    b. Attach qr-backup-XXXX.tar.gz
              qr-backup-XXXX.tar.gz.sig
              qr-backup_XXXX_all.deb
9. Update the arch package, since I'm the maintainer.
    a. git clone ssh://aur@aur.archlinux.org/qr-backup.git
    b. Edit PKGBUILD. Bump the version number, delete the SHA.
    c. makepkg -g, add that to PKGBUILD
    d. makepkg --printsrcinfo > .SRCINFO
    e. Run makepkg, makepkg -i to make sure it's all good
